Such data can be downloaded from Amazon which collects reviews from customers, and possibly specialized rating sites for electronics, entertainment, restaurants, and other products and services. A sentiment data set using Amazon data is available with papers that report on research using it from here (Links to an external site.).\n",

Briefly report on SentiWordNet (Links to an external site.) and how it can be used with Python and WordNet to classify a corpus of reviews (tweets are not easy to get right since they do not use “natural” language). Do not get bogged down preparing the reviews for analysis. It is acceptable to find a research paper (Links to an external site.) or blog that reports on such use.\n",
