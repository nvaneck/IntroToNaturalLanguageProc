    "\n",
    "2. Train the sentiment classifier using logistic regression, but follow the directions in this paragraph. Use a corpus of tagged reviews similar to the way Amazon does it. Each review is given a tag on a scale, say, from 1 to 5, the higher the tag the more favorable the review, or as categories like favorable, unfavorable, neutral. Treat the ratings as a set of categories, not numerical values. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Find files, one for favorable words and one for unfavorable ones, and count the number of each in each review. Also count the numbers of words that change these into the other category, like “not” and “hardly” as in “hardly amusing”, the “un-“ prefix as in “unhappy”, and the “a-“ prefix as in “amoral”, and any other negators you can think off or find. Regular expressions are useful for this. Lists of these may be more difficult to find so you may have to make some up. These counts become the features (independent variables) used as inputs to the logistic regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Each review has three independent variables/features: count of favorable words, count of unfavorable words, and the count of negators, and one dependent variable, the category with the highest probability. Then report a confusion matrix to show how accurate the model matches the training set categories. If you get enough data create the training, validation, and testing partitions and use the matrix functions in Excel, the xla Excel add-in, or a matrix algebra package like MATLAB or TensorFlow. Show your results in a confusion matrix. \n",

    "4. Examine the methods, such as document embeddings, in A&S Ch4 from p83 on applied to sentence tokenizers. Compare them to those BKL sections on processing sentences. "
