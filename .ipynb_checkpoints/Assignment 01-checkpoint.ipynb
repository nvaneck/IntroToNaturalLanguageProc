    "Page 5: Try searching for other words; to save re-typing, you might be able to use up-arrow, Ctrl-up-arrow, or Alt-p to access the previous command and modify the word being searched. You can also try search- es on some of the other texts we have included. For example, search Sense and Sensibility for the word affection, using text2.concord ance(\"affection\"). Search the book of Genesis to find out how long some people lived, using: text3.concordance(\"lived\"). You could look at text4, the Inaugural Address Corpus, to see examples of English going back to 1789, and search for words like nation, terror, god to see how these words have been used differently over time. Weâ€™ve also included text5, the NPS Chat Corpus: search this for unconventional words like im, ur, lol. (Note that this corpus is uncensored!)\n"
